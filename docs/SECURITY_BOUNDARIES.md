# Security Boundaries

Personal CFO Agent v0.1 is read-only, offline by default, and connector-first.

## Hard Boundaries

- No trading.
- No order placement.
- No cash transfer.
- No password storage.
- No private keys in the repository.
- No browser cookies in the repository.
- No browser automation.
- No Singpass automation.
- No CPF/IRAS/HDB scraping.
- No Webull unofficial API.
- No POEMS unofficial API.
- No recommendation output.
- No buy/sell/hold advice.
- No tax, estate, or insurance advice.
- No PM prompt wiring.
- No AI PM Agent import path.

## Secrets

All connector configuration must come from environment variables. The application must never write secret material to disk or logs. Generated reports, local config, browser session artifacts, screenshots, real account data, and private keys are ignored by Git.

## Live Connector Rule

IBKR v0.1.1 is the first supervised read-only proof harness. It requires `--provider ibkr --allow-live-read`, complete environment configuration, and a manually started TWS or IB Gateway session. Other providers remain non-live. Generated live outputs must stay under ignored `reports/` paths.
